          <p>
            TypeScript (or “TS”) is a language built upon JavaScript (or “JS”),
            the primary (perhaps a vast, vast understatement) language used to
            program web applications. The term “built upon” is important here —
            TS is “strict superset” of JavaScript. This means that any valid JS
            program is also a valid TS program.
          </p>
          <p>
            TypeScript (or TS) first appeared 9 years ago, in 2012. It is
            written and maintained by Microsoft. It is now one of the

              >most popular</a
            >
            programming tools in the world. If TS were a startup company, early
            investors would be breaking out the champagne. Without exaggerating,
            I think most webdevs would agree with me in thinking that it won’t
            be long before “vanilla” JS will no longer be shipped in any new
            commercial product. For anything more than a personal/hobby project,
            JS will be constrained in TS shackles.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the last two paragraphs irritated you, you’re not alone — they
            irritate me as well, although true. Buzzwords cut through all
            articles promoting some library or another, and they make it
            impossible to make actual value judgements. Moreover, they distract
            the reader from actual trends and move the focus from concepts to
            products. If C# were to switch out Java in its inception, do we
            envision a vastly different developmental landscape in the 90s? I’d
            argue against that. Rather, Java and its viable alternatives
            heralded the well-known trend (and one of more popular religions) of
            Object Oriented Programming, or OOP.

            So, the following case for TypeScript is actually a general case for
            using a type system in JavaScript programming. TypeScript is just
            the current best-in-class (by a wide chasm), and an objectively
            excellent candidate for accomplishing this goal. Let’s examine a
            very simple function in JS:
          </p>
          <pre
            class="language-javascript shiki shiki-themes synthwave-84"
          ><code><span class="line" line="1"><span style="--shiki-default:#FEDE5D">function</span><span style="--shiki-default:#36F9F6"> multiply</span><span style="--shiki-default:#BBBBBB">(</span><span style="--shiki-default:#FF7EDB;--shiki-default-font-style:italic">x</span><span style="--shiki-default:#BBBBBB">, </span><span style="--shiki-default:#FF7EDB;--shiki-default-font-style:italic">y</span><span style="--shiki-default:#BBBBBB">) {
</span></span><span class="line" line="2"><span style="--shiki-default:#FEDE5D">  return</span><span style="--shiki-default:#FF7EDB"> x</span><span style="--shiki-default:#FEDE5D"> *</span><span style="--shiki-default:#FF7EDB"> y</span><span style="--shiki-default:#BBBBBB">;
</span></span><span class="line" line="3"><span style="--shiki-default:#BBBBBB">}
</span></span></code></pre>
          <p>Let’s call this function:</p>
          <pre
            class="language-javascript shiki shiki-themes synthwave-84"
          ><code><span class="line" line="1"><span style="--shiki-default:#36F9F6">multiply</span><span style="--shiki-default:#BBBBBB">(</span><span style="--shiki-default:#2EE2FA">2</span><span style="--shiki-default:#BBBBBB">, </span><span style="--shiki-default:#2EE2FA">3</span><span style="--shiki-default:#BBBBBB">); </span><span style="--shiki-default:#848BBD;--shiki-default-font-style:italic">// = 6
</span></span></code></pre>
          <p>
            So thats very nice. We have a function that multiplies two numbers.
            But let’s call it with a string:
          </p>

          <pre
            class="language-javascript shiki shiki-themes synthwave-84"
          ><code><span class="line" line="1"><span style="--shiki-default:#36F9F6">multiply</span><span style="--shiki-default:#BBBBBB">(</span><span style="--shiki-default:#2EE2FA">2</span><span style="--shiki-default:#BBBBBB">, </span><span style="--shiki-default:#FF8B39">"hello"</span><span style="--shiki-default:#BBBBBB">); </span><span style="--shiki-default:#848BBD;--shiki-default-font-style:italic">// = NaN
</span></span></code></pre>
          <p>
            This is obviously a nonsensical operation (although
            <a
              href="https://www.pythoncentral.io/use-python-multiply-strings/"
              rel="nofollow"
              >in Python</a
            >
            multiplying 2 by “hello” would return “hellohello”. This is
            adorable)&hairsp;—&hairsp;and we receive NaN, which is a special
            value in JS which means “not a number” (complying with the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN" rel="nofollow"
              >IEEE 754 floating point standard</a
            >). So it was a syntactically legal operation, but I doubt anyone
            writing that function wants their function to be called with a
            string value. Accordingly, this function could be written in TS like
            this:
          </p>
          <pre
            class="language-typescript shiki shiki-themes synthwave-84"
          ><code><span class="line" line="1"><span style="--shiki-default:#FEDE5D">function</span><span style="--shiki-default:#36F9F6"> multiply</span><span style="--shiki-default:#BBBBBB">(</span><span style="--shiki-default:#FF7EDB;--shiki-default-font-style:italic">x</span><span style="--shiki-default:#FEDE5D">:</span><span style="--shiki-default:#FE4450"> number</span><span style="--shiki-default:#BBBBBB">, </span><span style="--shiki-default:#FF7EDB;--shiki-default-font-style:italic">y</span><span style="--shiki-default:#FEDE5D">:</span><span style="--shiki-default:#FE4450"> number</span><span style="--shiki-default:#BBBBBB">) {

</span></span><span class="line" line="3"><span style="--shiki-default:#BBBBBB">}
</span></span></code></pre>
          <p>
            We’ve simply told TS that we don’t allow non number inputs to be
            given to the function. Now the second function call with the string
            value is illegal — TypeScript will yell at you and your editor will
            highlight it with red, mean squiggly lined until you change it,
            optionally forbidding you to ship your code until you do. This may
            seem annoying at first — you must sprinkle type hints all around the
            place for TS to be happy, and it will yell at you if you dont obey
            your own rules. Migrating most of my company’s codebase was a lesson
            in patience in that regard. But the effort pays off in compound down
            the road, and let’s examine why.
          </p>
          <h3 id="so-what"><a href="#so-what">So What</a></h3>
          <p>
            The
            <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" rel="nofollow"
              >Python zen</a
            >
            teaches us “Explicit is better than implicit” — users familiar with
            type systems (who are gawking at my “discovery” of a feature
            existing in languages for over 45 years) might think I’m invoking
            this rule for readability reasons — as in, any person reading my
            multiply function with type hints will know immediately that the
            inputs are 2 numbers. This is true (although, TS has very powerful
            type inference, such that in many cases you may leave off type
            hints). Another valid point would be the functionality aspect — as
            I’ve mentioned, calling multiply with “hello” is now impossible,
            which is a great thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            For me, though, the most compelling case for type systems is more
            conceptual. TS forces you to explicitly fill your programs with
            assertions that mirror your assumptions about the program. Let’s
            rewrite our multiplication function:
          </p>
          <pre
            class="language-typescript shiki shiki-themes synthwave-84"
          ><code><span class="line" line="1"><span style="--shiki-default:#FEDE5D">function</span><span style="--shiki-default:#36F9F6"> fruitPrice</span><span style="--shiki-default:#BBBBBB">(</span><span style="--shiki-default:#FF7EDB;--shiki-default-font-style:italic">basePrice</span><span style="--shiki-default:#FEDE5D">:</span><span style="--shiki-default:#FE4450"> number</span><span style="--shiki-default:#BBBBBB">, </span><span style="--shiki-default:#FF7EDB;--shiki-default-font-style:italic">quantity</span><span style="--shiki-default:#FEDE5D">:</span><span style="--shiki-default:#FE4450"> number</span><span style="--shiki-default:#BBBBBB">) {

</span></span></code></pre>
          <p>
            This function works great in dev with mock data, we receive the
            price of fruit from the server and the quantity from the client.
            Before pushing to production, the backend dev tells us that due to
            new architecture decisions, the price of certain fruit may be
            undetermined — now we may receive null, or an empty string when
            asking for the price of a fruit. Now when I call the price function
            with this new value, which may be undefined or a number, TypeScript
            yells because it know I am passing in a value which may not be a
            legal number.
          </p>
          <p>
            Again, this is great — my function would fail without a rewrite. But
            the real lesson I can take from the squiggly lines is about my
            assumptions. TS punishes you for a lenient or thoughtlessly written
            piece of code — it forces you to reexamine what you think the
            program actually does. So fruitPrice will undoubtedly have to
            change, but now you know where you casually gave yourself a break by
            assuming a stricter subset of input than in reality. Now you know
            your program must take an undetermined price into account. TS will
            selflessly tell you where this assumption is relevant, but the real
            takeaway is forcing you to more strictly define your program.
          </p>

            Something must be said about the tool in order to encourage its’
            use, aside from touting the general benefits of a type system. So
            why TS, after all?
          </p>
          <p>
            From a maintenance perspective, TS is, as mentioned, maintained by
            Microsoft. There are constant releases fixing bugs and meeting
            performance goals. New features are great, but really a dev needs to
            know that the project won’t

            I think one of the reasons for TS’s steady success is its’ core
            product — type systems for JS. It has cultivated many features that
            were eventually swallowed into vanilla JS —
            <a

              >nullish coalescing</a
            >
            etc. But really, the main feature which browsers cannot adopt is the
            type system — JS is inherently dynamic, and a type system is a
            radical change browsers cannot simply add in. So by not competing
            with juggernaut browsers over its’ main feature, it can prevail
            safely without fearing a sudden hostile takeover.
          </p>
          <p>
            From a non maintenance perspective, TS has built its’ type system
            around widely used JS patterns. One example is that the TS type
            system is
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_type_system"
              rel="nofollow"
              >structural</a
            >
            rather than nominal — basically, that one value is equivalent to
            another if it shares the structure of the other value. For example,
            a function that recieves { a: number; } as an argument, will also
            accept { a: number; b: number; } — the second type can be treated as
            the first type for all intents and purposes that the first type is
            used for in the function.
          </p>
          <p>
            In many other type systems, types can act in for other types only if
            an explicit (=nominal) relationship was tied between them, such as
            inheritance. A structural type system fits the JS pattern of
            constant usage of anonynous objects and values (including
            functions), without explicitly calling constructors and so forth.
            Forcing nonimal typing on existing JS code would change the style
            and patterns devs are used to. This is not the only advantage to a
            structural type system, but it illustrates the thinking behind the
            language design. For more on the unique fit between TS and JS (I
            didn’t even touch on the functional aspect), I strongly recommend
            watching

            In a final note, moving this text from notepad to an actual text
            editor with a spellchecker has shamefully revealed many squiggly
            lines, red, blue and green. In an imperfect analogy, JS editors have
            long had red lines for syntax errors (a.k.a. spelling mistakes). TS
            is more than a library, as it introduces a feature entirely
            impossible in current JS — green and blue squiggly lines, for
            contextual and grammatical errors. Suddenly my programs are more
            than blocks of black text, they speak to me and challenge my
