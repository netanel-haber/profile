            This article aims to explain basic concepts related to concurrency,
            which is used to solve performance related problems. It starts and
            ends with Python (CPython, mostly), as a tie from and back into
            reality - but isn't really about Python at all. Actually, it isn't
            about any language, framework or library in particular. It aims to
            take a step back from questions of application and start from first
            principles.

            Let's start by stating some facts about python concurrency. They may
            seem contradictory or confusing - the rest of the article aims to
            provide more clarity as to how they make sense together. It should
            be noted that some of these facts pertain to a standard use of
            Python - it is possible to bypass some limitations, either by using
            a less popular Python implementation, or by using non-standard
            <a href="https://numba.pydata.org/" rel="nofollow">tools</a> and
            libraries.

            (Input/Output) work. It helps to first state a basic fact: Computers
            have a fundamental bottleneck - they cannot execute more than one
            command at any time. Modern "computers" actually contain multiple
            computation units that can each execute one command at any given
            time. To compare the two types of work, we will first look at a
            single CPU core.

            If we task this computer with calculating
            <code class="">(2 ^ 19) / (3 ^ 33)</code>, it will boil the task
            down to a list of discreet commands to execute<sup
              ><a
                aria-current="page"

            end of a meal at a restaurant. We have two tasks ahead of us:
            Calculating the tip and calculating when to leave in order to catch
            a bus. The former calculation may penalize us
            <code class="">X</code> of our time, while the latter may take
            <code class="">Y</code> of our time. In other words, altogether
            <code class="">X+Y</code> work must be done. The "brain-power"
            (=time) will be spent, regardless of the way the work is divided,
            sliced or diced. <strong>This is CPU-bound work.</strong>

            Now the computer is tasked with scraping Google search results. It
            receives a term as an argument and must retrieve the first 10 pages
            of results. So it:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Asks for the first page <span>10ms</span>.</li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >Waits for the result to return from Google servers
                <span>80ms</span>.</strong
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              Receives the result and saves it in a file <span>10ms</span>.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            It then repeats these steps for all 10 pages. The execution times
            are just an example, but resemble real-world times for similar
            programs. So let's focus on 2 - it seems to be our performance
            bottleneck, at 80% of all execution time. The key word here is
            <strong>waiting</strong>. We have such a powerful tool at our
            disposal, and it mostly waits - i.e., does nothing, for most of our
            program. That's pretty unsavory. Next time you plan something with
            friends, try waiting for each friend to confirm before asking the
            next friend. <strong>This is I/O-bound work</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So a
            <span class="term cursor-default px-1 rounded">CPU-bound</span>
            task is one where the primary performance bottleneck is actual
            <strong>work</strong> that cannot be avoided. An
            <span class="term cursor-default px-1 rounded">I/O-bound</span>
            task is one where the primary performance bottleneck is actually
            just
            <strong>waiting</strong>
            for an external piece of data.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is common sense that alleviating performance pain for problems
            with different bottlenecks will look different for each type of
            task. This is actually the key to our primary question. assessing
            the type of work before us - CPU, I/O or a mixture of both - can
            help us know in advance if certain solutions are applicable.
          </p>

          <p>
            So for the first calculation task, we have a discreet list of
            commands we need to execute. Any unit can only execute one line at a
            time. We've already mentioned modern computers have many such units.
            So, for a slow program, the solution seems clear - divide and
            conquer. We divide our computation into smaller coherent parts (so
            we can assemble the solutions later for the final product), and give
            each available unit in the computer one part at a time to execute.
            For example, if we have a computation that can take 8X time, that
            can be divided into 8 smaller computations that each can take X time
            - and we have 8 cores - we can now accomplish this task in X time.
            This means that in order to enhance performance for CPU-bound tasks
            we need
            <span class="term cursor-default px-1 rounded"
              >parallelization</span
            >
            - computing simultaneously on multiple units.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second task, where we were mostly waiting, can complete faster
            by being able to do other work while waiting. In the wild, you might
            see the term
            <span class="term cursor-default px-1 rounded">asynchronous</span>
            used to describe such programs that allow for doing work while
            waiting, depending on the language or framework. We will use this
            term as well<sup

          <p>
            On a side note, let's notice a subtle difference between the
            enhancements we may gain from optimizing both types of work. While
            both parallelization and asynchronous solutions can
            <strong>save on overall execution time</strong>, they cannot both
            <strong>reduce CPU usage and resources</strong>.
          </p>

            Consider 10 taps that produce 10L of water an hour. We need 100
            liters altogether, so we're smart - we use 10 bottles and run all 10
            taps at once. This should get us done in a minute, rather than 10
            minutes. The trouble is the guy that arrived with us is also smart,
            and wants his 100L's worth of water too. This is the trouble with
            CPU work - the computer is capped at how much work it can accomplish
            simultaneously. To this end, "optimizing" your program by
            parallelizing its work doesn't really improve anything in terms of
            the amount of hard work that needs to be completed<sup

          <p>
            In contrast, optimizing I/O bound programs can actually
            <strong>reduce CPU usage</strong> - one problem with I/O bound
            programs is that they needlessly waste CPU resources. In the best
            case scenario, we can get rid of almost all of the idle CPU time -
            which can be used to do more work<sup
              ><a

          <p>
            So, CPU bound tasks could use parallel computing to achieve better
            performance, while for I/O bound tasks we would simply try to do
            more work while waiting. Generally, the blanket term for any
            solution for both of these bounds is
            <span class="term cursor-default px-1 rounded">concurrency</span>.
            This denotes programs that cannot be thought about sequentially - in
            order to achieve either solution, the language will now expose
            syntax and interfaces that, while affording us the performance
            benefits of concurrent code, prevent us from being able to read our
            programs "line after line". It will now be possible for different
            bits of our programs to execute out of order.

            As mentioned, different frameworks expose different interfaces to
            programmers for writing concurrent code. Fundamentally, there are
            two challenges for language designers:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Implementation</strong>
              - Developing the actual implementation(s) and mechanism(s) to
              allow for such code to run. This is not a trivial problem,
              especially if existing languages want to introduce new solutions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Interface</strong>
              - Exposing the syntax and high-level tools with which users may
              interact with the implementations. This is also not a trivial
              problem - as mentioned, thinking about concurrent code isn't
              straightforward. Accordingly, a good language will look for
              interfaces that allow for expressing concurrent code in a
              readable, easy-to-reason-about way.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Let's give an example for a challenge on the implementation side.
            Cpython suffers from the

            - the global interpreter lock. This means that the python
            interpreter cannot run more than one line of python bytecode at any
            given time. This means that Python effectively bans parallelization
            (<strong>within the same process</strong> - more on this soon), and
            therefore cannot improve the execution time of CPU-bound programs
            using concurrency<sup

            Let's look at another example for a challenge, this time on the
            interface side. Javascript, an async language by default, used to
            only allow running code asynchronously using callbacks functions.
            These functions are passed to async calls (like api requests). These
            callbacks will eventually run with the result of async operations
            and execute side effects, such as displaying the result of the
            request on the page. Once we register a callback, we can continue
            working while the resource fetches.
          </p>
          <p>
            This pattern suffered from a problem dubbed

            meant nested callbacks, caused increasing right-indentation of code,
            until the final callback code started on the 100th column, say.

            Let's take a cursory look at 3 basic archetypes of concurrency
            solutions, using a shoe factory as analogy.

              <span class="term cursor-default px-1 rounded"
                >Multiprocessing</span
              >
              - multiprocessing can reduce the execution time of
              <strong>both</strong> types of work. It involves using multiple OS
              processes within the same program, and coordinating between them.
              It is slow and very resource consuming in comparison with other
              concurrency solutions. If we use Python as an example, every
              process we spawn to run our code will, for example, contain its
              own running Python interpreter including the initial overhead of
              starting the process and the interpreter.<br />Multiprocessing is
              analogous to building a brand new shoe factory for every order of
              shoes we receive, rather than using existing factories to produce
              multiple shoes. Every factory has an enormous initial construction
              overhead, it takes up a lot of real estate, and sharing resources
              and information between the factories is very slow. Back to
              Python: The GIL, which limits Python execution to one line at a
              time, only enforces its lock within the same process since every
              process is its own complete Python entity. This means that Python
              can allow real cpu parallelization using multiprocessing (refer to

                >Multithreading</span
              >
              - multithreading is a tricky, widely available solution for lean
              concurrency with shared resources within the same process. Threads
              are lighter execution units than processes. Let's refer back to
              the factory analogy. Here, we use just the one factory (=process)
              to run our code. We achieve concurrency by employing many workers
              to perform many tasks. The workers share the factory facilities
              and machines, so we save big on resources. If they can work at the
              same time (=in parallel), we can produce more in a given time
              (<span class="term cursor-default px-1 rounded">CPU-bound</span>
              work).<br />It is important to state that multithreading can also
              provide performance benefits for (<span
                class="term cursor-default px-1 rounded"
                >I/O-bound</span
              >
              work). In languages with a GIL like Python, we effectively only
              allow one employee to work at any given time, and we switch
              between them. Why is this still useful? Workers, when not idle,
              can schedule deliveries, start long-running processes on machines,
              etc. - so if our factory mostly consists of kick-starting
              autonomous tasks (<span class="term cursor-default px-1 rounded"
                >I/O-bound</span
              >
              work), multiple employees can still accomplish much more than a
              single employee. With the meager time each employee is given, he
              can start some independent task, such as scheduling a delivery. We
              immediately yell "freeze!" and transfer the working rights to
              another worker. He too, registers some task. When we return to the
              first worker, our delivery has already arrived, and our worker can
              program a processing machine before we freeze him again.<br />Back
              to reality. While multithreading is the ideal solution for
              CPU-bound work, it is less than ideal for I/O bound work. Even in
              a language that allows multi-threaded parallelism, our program
              still has idle CPU usage while any given thread waits for some I/O
              operation to complete. In addition, context switching between
              threads is time consuming, and as running permission is a zero-sum
              game, every millisecond of time given to one thread is a
              millisecond taken from another. So every thread is still resource
              consuming (though much leaner than a full process).

                >Asynchronous Tasks</span
              >- This solution is relevant to I/O bound work, and can solve the
              wasted resource issues highlighted in the previous paragraph when
              using multithreading for I/O bound work. This is the final
              improvement to our factory, and it includes paying one of our
              employees more so he's willing to "multi-task".<br />Now, we hire
              a supervisor and buy a whiteboard. Our supervisor's job is to
              provide our employee with tasks to do when a task is completed.
              The worker schedules some delivery. Instead of waiting for the
              delivery, he first writes on the whiteboard: "Supervisor, please
              let me know when the delivery has arrived for further processing".
              Then he can immediately begin scheduling another delivery, or
              operating on deliveries from yesterday. The supervisor keeps an
              eye on the loading dock, and eventually the first delivery
              arrives. He erases the task from the whiteboard and tells the
              worker, who begins processing the delivery that just arrived. And
              so on.<br />So this solution requires a couple of components, but
              it can saves immensely on resources when the work is mostly I/O
              bound - it needs a single thread for our actual code (the worker),
              and some constant number of other threads and data structures to
              inform our thread of new tasks and keep an eye out for completed
              async operations (the supervisor) and keep tabs on registered
              tasks (the whiteboard). Our code registers some async task, and
              requests to be notified when it returns with the results. It
              notifies the framework what it wants to do with the result, but
              the syntax of how it is notified and the underlying objects are
              very framework and languages specific.

                For brevity, we also implicitly disregard a further step where
                parallelism can come in handy - some calculations may perhaps
                allow for non-sequential execution of certain steps. This
                doesn't diminish the point, though. Say we've found the most
                reduced version of the algorithm, split among as many units as
                possible. We are still left with "hard" work needing to be
                completed. So we've tried our best to reach a solution in as
                little time as possible - but we still need to bite the bullet

                I think that for a programmer like me, who's written only
                consumers - programs that just consume computing power - it may
                be harder to understand this perspective. Once you write a
                provider, such as an operating system, you suddenly understand
                this. You own
                <strong>all</strong> of the resources - so when you parallelize
                management processes you'll notice you're stepping on your own
                toes - all of your programs are standing in line for water.

                We can also quantify CPU usage as energy expenditure to further
                illustrate the point. There is no "free" energy - to this end,
                parallelizing CPU-bound programs cannot save energy. Async code
                also cannot save energy - but it
                <strong>can</strong>
                minimize wasting energy. A more concise (but, in reality, wrong)
                framing of this idea is that the ideal program is only bound by
                CPU usage, as a program where we've solved all I/O issues is
                left with only CPU usage. This program doesn't exist, except in
                theory. I/O includes loading the next CPU instructions and
                reading registers as well, for example. In addition, These are

                A clock-cycle saved is a clock-cycle earned. This key insight,
                that a best case scenario asynchronous framework may reduce CPU
                usage, is what allows event-driven servers to serve many
                concurrent requests when the requests are mostly I/O bound. A
                new thread need not be created to serve every request - this can
                save an enormous amount of resources, in contrast with a
                thread-per-request framework which is capped by the realistic
                amount of threads that the server can maintain, thus severely
                limiting the vertical scaling of the server's possible
                concurrent requests.

                Assuming only one line of Python bytecode is running allowed the
                writers of python interpreters to write simpler implementations.
                The trouble is, years later multi-threaded parallelization
                became important to many programming fields where performance is
                crucial. Now, existing Python implementations such as CPython
                are in trouble because the one-line assumption is fundamentally
                baked in to the underlying C and lifting the GIL as-is would
                break the interpreter. The

                This allows us to transform nested callbacks into a list,
                eliminating callback nesting. Not much later, the language
                introduced a syntactical wrapper for the promise API that uses
                the

                a synchronous look, therefore arguably improving readability.
